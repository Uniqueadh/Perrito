      <h3>“Unopened Memories”</h3>
      <p>There are photos.
I don't delete them.
I don't revisit them either.
I just keep it on my phone
Like something paused, not gone, not alive.
I know if I open them, something will come up.
Maybe a version of me l've buried.
Maybe a feeling I'm not ready to feel again.
So l don't touch them.
I just let them sit.
Quiet reminders of something I once had, and maybe still haven't fully let go.

      <h3>Not Meant To Happen</h3>
      <p>I wasn't supposed to fall in love with you, we were supposed to be just friends.
But i let my heart slip past the boundaries i promised to stay within.
Now, here we are,
strangers to each other with memories too heavy to hold but too beautiful to forget.
You're the person i never meant to fall for, youre everything i never wanted to lose.
I wish i could go back to before i crossed that line, when i could still speak to you without the pain in my chest.
when silence between us was comfortable, not heavy.
I ruined everything
I wasn't supposed to fall in love with you, but i did.</p>

      <h3>She love being women</h3>
      <p>You are music
constantly fighting its way into my mind a violent, rebellious, but beautiful melody i try to turn down the volume i try anything to turn down the volume i fight i talk i write i travel but at the end of the day
i submerge my head in water and i scream why won't you get out of my head?

         <h3>I love you the way you are even tho you are not with me.</h3>
          <p>I love you the way you are even when you doubt yourself,<br>
          Even when you feel lost or unsure.<br>
          Your laughter, your quirks, your gentle heart.<br>
          All the little things that make you, you.<br>
          I love you not for perfection,<br>
          But for your honesty, your kindness, your light.<br>
          You are enough, just as you are.<br>
          And I love you, simply, for being you.
